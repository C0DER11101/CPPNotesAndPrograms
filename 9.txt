write() member function of ostream class.
-------------------------------------------------


the write() member function of ostream class has the following syntax:

	cout.write(line, size);

size is the length of the line to be displayed and can be any value(according to the desired needs of the user)


	cout.write(s, 20);

let's say you entered a string as follows:

	Hello


then the output for cout.write(s, 20) will be:
	
	HelloeïF*V�

what we have here is the string 'Hello' along with some garbage value....
____________________
Property of write()

it keeps on displaying even after encountering the null character; if the original size of the string is greater than the length of the line entered by the user
then it displays beyond the bounds of the line!!
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Here the original size of the string(passed as parameter of write()) was 20, but we entered a string of only 5 characters i.e. 'Hello', so write() didnot stop
even after encountering the null character at the end of the string 'Hello' and went on displaying beyond the bounds of 'Hello' because write() was supposed to
display 20 characters in the output.:w

One good solution to such type of problems is to use the member function of string.h  i.e. strlen() which will return the exact length of the string that we entered.

Like in this example below:

	cout.write(s, strlen(s));

This will display the output as:

	Hello

So, beware while using write()............
