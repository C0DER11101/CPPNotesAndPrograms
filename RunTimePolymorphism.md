# RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM

_It defers the linking of a funcion call to a particular function at the run-time._

_It is not known which function will be invoked till an object actuall makes the function call during the program's execution._

**_This is late or dynamic binding_**

**Run-time polymorphism is achieved with the help of virtual functions.**
