The .cpp file with the same name as this text file contains some really helpful information.


SYNTAX:
cin.getline(str, size);

Now, the getline() function continues reading input as long as it doesnot encounter a newline '\n' or the number of characters
read doesnot read size-1.
The reading terminates as soon one of them occurs.

The newline character is read but not saved, it is instead replaced by the null character(ASCII value 0).


So in the program,
when you enter a string that has size >=5, the getline() function terminates its reading as soon as it encounters the fifth
chharacters or a newline. The newline is replaced by the null character and discarded which is accepted by the character variable
ch and thus the output comes as it should.


No matter how many characters you enter after size-1 characters, getline() doesnot accept them. It only accepts the size-1
characters that you entered and the rest is discarded and ofcourse you do press the enter key after giving the input, that
enter key is the newline for getline() which it replaces with the null character and discards it, just like cin discards a newline
character.
