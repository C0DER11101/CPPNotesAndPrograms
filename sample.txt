.cpp file with same name exists.

Maybe in cout.precision(d), the decimal point(.) is also counted, so that's why it shows d-1 digits after the decimal point.


Now, in this cpp program, I wrote the following lines:

cout.precision(3);
cout.width(5);
cout<<1.2345;
cout.width(5);
cout<<45<<endl;

the cout.precision(3) function is applied for both 1.2345 and 45, but cout.width(5) is applied for only 1.23, that's why I
had to give another cout.width(5) before 45.


Now, the first two lines basically mean this:

"display the 2 digits after the decimal point in a field of five character width."(this whole line has been taken from a book).


In simple words:

cout.precision(3); sets the precision for 2 digits after the decimal point.
cout.width(5); tells that the field width of the number should be 5.
So if we combine the two statements together then we get the following statement:

'the precision has been set to display 2 digits after decimal point for a number that has a field width of 5!!!'


So the output is:

 1.23   45
