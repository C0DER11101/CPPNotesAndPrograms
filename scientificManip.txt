Explanation of .cpp file with the same name as this one....


cout.unsetf() takes only one argument and that is the name of the flag.....

resetiosflags() also takes one argument and that is the name of the flag....


resetiosflags() and unsetf() are work the same way....

they unset the set flag, so that the output is displayed in its usual format.....


also, cout.unsetf() can be used for setiosflags() and resetiosflags() can also be used for 
cout.setf(ios::scientific, ios::floatfield)
