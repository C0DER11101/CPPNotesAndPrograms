# About [p4.cpp](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPPNotesAndPrograms/blob/master/Namespaces/NewDataTypes/namespaces/p4.cpp)

**Defining functions outside of namespaces just like defining member functions outside of a class.**

Consider the following snippet:

```c++
namespace N
{
	int a;
	int b;

	void product()
	{
		cout<<"\n"<<a<<" x "<<b<<" = "<<a*b<<"\n";
	}

	void input(int, int);

}


using namespace N;

void N::input(int x, int y)
{
	a=x;
	b=y;
}

int main(void)
{
	// code.....

	input(2, 3);
	product();

	return 0;
}
```

Here, the very important thing to notice is that even after writing `using namespace N;`, we are defining the function `input()` by using the scope resolution operator. To put in simple terms, the function `input()` should have been defined like this:

```c++
using namespace N;

void input(int x, int y)
{
	a=x;
	b=y;
}
```

But, we cannot do this as this might throw ambiguity error!! Even after writing `using namespace N`, you have to use the scope resolution operator to resolve any ambiguity that may arise.

**When a function that is declared inside a namespace is defined outside, it should be qualified(i.e defined by using the scope resolution operator)**.
