# About

**wchar_t** is a character type defined in ANSI C++ to hold 16-bit wide characters.

ANSI C++ also introduced a new character literal known as _wide_character_ literal which uses two bytes of memory.


Wide_character literals begin with the letter `L`, below is an example:

```c++
L'xy'
```
