Explanation of the .cpp file with the same name as this one.
Explanation:

ios::dec, ios::hex, ios::oct

int a=12;

cout<<"The decimal, hexadecimal and octal representation of "<<a<<" are:\n";

cout.setf(ios::dec, ios::basefield);
cout<<a<<"\n";

cout.setf(ios::hex, ios::basefield);
cout<<a<<"\n";

cout.setf(ios::oct, ios::basefield);
cout<<a<<"\n";


when you write,
cout.setf(ios::dec, ios::basefield); before cout<<a<<"\n";
this basically ensures that the value of a printed is a decimal equivalent of the decimal value of a(in simple words, the decimal
equivalent of the decimal value of a is the decimal of a itself).

Similarly,
when you write,
cout.setf(ios::hex, ios::basefield); before cout<<a<<"\n";
this basically ensures that the value of a printed is a hexadecimal equivalent of the decimal value of a.

Same can for cout.setf(ios::oct, ios::basefield);
