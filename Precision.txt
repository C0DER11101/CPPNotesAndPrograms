Explanation of the .cpp file with the same name as this text file.

The precision() function in C++

SYNTAX:
cout.precision(d);


d is the number of digits to be displayed after the decimal point.

In my case, however, when I write:

cout.precision(3);
cout<<sqrt(2)<<endl;
cout<<3.14159<<endl;
cout<<34.56234<<endl;


The result is:

1.41
3.14
34.6

For some reason, precision(3) shows 3-1 digits after the decimal point.


cout.precision(4);
cout<<sqrt(2)<<endl;
cout<<3.14159<<endl;
cout<<34.56234<<endl;

Now, these lines show me the following output:

1.414
3.142
34.56

Notice, that each number has 4-1 number of digits after the decimal point.
