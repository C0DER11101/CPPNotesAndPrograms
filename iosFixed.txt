Explanation of .cpp file with the same name.

cout.precision(3);
cout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield);
cout<<34.5<<endl;

The output is:
34.500

cout.precision(3); displays 3 digits after the decimal point.
cout.setf(ios::fixed, ios::floatfield); makes sure that number of digits displayed after the decimal point remains fixed i.e 
exactly 3 digits are displayed after the decimal point and not more than
that or less than that.

Again, the order of writing the precision() and setf() doesnot matter.
