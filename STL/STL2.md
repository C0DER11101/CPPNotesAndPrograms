# Algorithms

To have access to STL algorithms we must include `<algorithm>` header file in our program!!

STL also includes a few numeric algorithms under the header file `<numeric>`.


## Non-mutating algorithms

|Operations|Description|
|:---------|----------:|
|adjacent_find()|Finds adjacent pair of objects that are equal|
|count()|Counts occurence of a value in a sequence|
|count_if()|Counts numbe rof elements that matches a predicate|
|equal()|True if two ranges are the same|
|find()|Finds first occurence of a vlue in a sequence|
|find_end()|Finds last occurence of a value in a sequence|
|find_first_of()|Finds a vlaue from one sequence in another|
|find_if()|Finds first match of a predicate in a sequence|
|for_each()|Apply an operation to each element|
|mismatch()|Finds first elements for which two sequences differ|
|search()|Finds a subsequence within a sequence|
|search_n()|Finds a sequence of a specified number of similar elements|
