In '2.cpp',

the cin.get(c);
outside the while loop will take a string as input, but as we already know how the get() works, it will take only one character and leave the rest.
When the control will enter the loops the rest of the characters that the get() left will taken as input the cin.get(c) inside the while loop and 
this will continue until a newline is encountered!!!

cin.get(c);
while(c!='\n')
{
	cout<<c;
	cin.get(c);
}


if you enter "hello world", then the outer cin.get(c) will take only 'h' of "hello world" and leave "ello world", now the while loop checks the condition
c!='\n' and finds it to be false(note: get() also reads tabs, spaces and newlines) and outputs c which is 'h', then the cin.get(c); after cout<<c;

gets 'e' of "ello world" and leave "llo world" and now c's value is 'e'; again cout<<c; displays 'e' and this process continues on until the '\n' is encountered.

Note that when you pressed enter after giving the input in outer cin.get(c); the get() also read the newline character meaning that the string "hello world"

also had a newline character at the end as:


			"hello world\n"

Hope the explanation was okay(atleast for me  :))
