# Operators that cannot be overloaded!!


- class member access operators(., .*)
- scope resolution operator(::)
- size operator(sizeof)
- conditional operator(?:)


## Note

> When an operator is overloaded, its original meaning is not lost.
> Suppose '+' operator has been overloaded to add two vectors, but the same operator can also be used to add two integers!!!
