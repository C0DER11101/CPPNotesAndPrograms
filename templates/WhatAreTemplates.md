> When an object of specific type is defined for actual use, the template definition for that class is substituted with the required data type.

**Templates are also called _parameterized classes or functions_ because they are defined with a parameter that would be replaced by a specified data type at the time of actual use of the class or function.**

### SYNTAX

```c++
template<class T>
class classname
{
	// body of the class
};
```
